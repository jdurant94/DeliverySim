# DeliverySim

This was a Python porject where I had to simulate the delivery of a number of packages 
provided in a .csv file. I had to create up to 3 "trucks" to load up with packages and 
have them all delivered by there associated delivery time. I also had to have them all delivered 
by a specific time of day and the total travel distance of the trucks had to be within a 
certain milage.

Additionally, I had the applications input was a specific time of day. I had to run the simulation and
output the status of each package (delivered, in-transit) at that time.
